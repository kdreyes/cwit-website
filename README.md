An [MIT](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site/blob/main/LICENSE) licensed, simple, easily modifiable, statically-exportable [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) application that deploys automatically for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). Built using modern javascript, based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/), SCSS, [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and many other useful technologies.
